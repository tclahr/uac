### Updated Artifacts

- /dev was removed from the exclusion list during deleted process collection ([#65](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/65)).
- files/system/time_machine.yaml, files/system/wifi.yaml, files/applications/macos_dock.yaml are no longer available because the same artifacts are been collected by files/system/library_preferences.yaml.

### Deprecated Command Line Option

- '-o' command line switch is no longer available because it was replaced by '-s'.

### Deprecated Profiles

- 'full-with-memory-dump' profile is no longer available because '-a memory_dump/avml.yaml -p full' can be used instead.
- 'memory-dump-only' profile is no longer available because '-a memory_dump/avml.yaml' can be used instead.

### Fixed

- UAC now copies all collected artifacts to a destination directory if 'tar' tool is not available ([#63](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/63)).

## 2.2.0 (2022-05-02)

### New Features

- VMware ESXi is now fully supported as an operating system. Note that ESXi is not built upon the Linux kernel, and uses its own VMware proprietary kernel (the VMkernel) and software. So it misses most of the applications and components that are commonly found in all Linux distributions ([#33](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/33)).
- UAC now collects copies of '/proc/[pid]/exe' and their related '/proc/[pid]/fd/*' if they are shown up as being (deleted). They are copied using 'dd conv=swab' tool in order to avoid UAC output file being flagged and quarantined by any antivirus tool ([#36](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/36)).
- Added '--s3-presigned-url' switch which allows for pushing the output file to S3 pre-signed URLs (if curl available) ([#38](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/38)).
- Added '--s3-presigned-url-log-file' switch which allows for pushing the output log file to S3 pre-signed URLs (if curl available) ([#38](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/38)).
- Added '--delete-local-on-successful-transfer' switch which will delete both local output and log files after they are successfully transferred either via sftp or to a pre-signed S3 URL.
- AVML was updated to v0.6.1 ([#45](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/45)).

### New Artifacts

  - ls -l /proc/[pid]/cwd
  - cat /proc/[pid]/stack
  - cat /proc/[pid]/status
- New artifact was added to 'live_response/containers/docker.yaml':
  - docker stats --all --no-stream --no-trunc
  - docker network ls
  - docker network inspect [network_id]
  - docker volume ls
  - docker volume inspect [volume_name]
  - docker diff [container_id]
- New artifact was added to 'live_response/containers/podman.yaml':
  - podman stats --all --no-stream
  - podman network ls
  - podman network inspect [network_id]
  - podman volume ls
  - podman volume inspect [volume_name]
  - podman diff [container_id]

### Updated Artifacts

- ESXi support was added to the following artifacts:
  - live_response/process/ps.yaml
  - live_response/process/lsof.yaml
  - live_response/process/hash_running_processes.yaml
  - live_response/network/hostname.yaml

- 'files/applications/icloud_drive.yaml' was renamed to 'files/applications/icloud.yaml'.
- A new artifact to collect iCloud accounts information files was added to 'files/applications/icloud.yaml'.

### Deprecated

- '-o' command line switch was replaced by '-s', and will be removed in the next release. So don't forget to update your documentation.
- '--sftp-delete-local-on-success' command line switch was replaced by '--delete-local-on-successful-transfer'.

### Fixed

- Issue that was preventing UAC to collect files from home directories when executing it via EDR and the system HOME variable was not set by the current shell ([#47](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/47)).

## 2.1.0 (2022-02-15)

### Added

- Now you can use PROFILE (-p) and ARTIFACTS (-a) options together to create even more customizable collections. Please check the docs for more info. 
- '9p' file system, used by Microsoft's WSL to mount local drives, was added to the global file system exclusion list in 'config/uac.conf'. This avoids UAC to recursively search artifacts through mounted local drives (like C:).

### Added

### Added

- File creation time (Linux and ext4 file systems only) will now be collected by the bodyfile collector if debugfs tool is available on the target system. This will extremely increase the collection time, so it can be disabled by editing ```conf/uac.conf``` and setting BODY_FILE_CRTIME to false.
