## üîé About UAC

**UAC (Unix-like Artifacts Collector)** is a powerful and extensible incident response tool designed for forensic investigators, security analysts, and IT professionals. It automates the collection of artifacts from a wide range of Unix-like systems, including AIX, ESXi, FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, NetBSD, NetScaler, OpenBSD and Solaris.

Whether you're handling an intrusion, conducting forensic investigations, or performing compliance checks, UAC simplifies and accelerates data collection while minimizing reliance on external support during critical incidents.

### Key Highlights

- üìÇ Fully customizable via YAML profiles for tailored data collection.
- ‚ö° Lightweight, portable, and requires no installation or dependencies.
- üîí Adheres to the order of volatility to ensure reliable data acquisition.
- üõ† Designed for diverse environments, including IoT devices and NAS systems.
